#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

o(n)

b)

0(n log n)

c)

0(n)


## Exercise II

Runtime complexity 0(log n) - Binary search

Take the height of building in n
start at n / 2 floor
drop egg
if egg breaks
    n = n - 1
    drop egg
    if egg does not break
        return n
    else
        remove all floors to the right
    repeat
else
    remove all floors to left
    repeat
